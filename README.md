## Overview
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognizer is a machine learning project aimed at classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. This project uses k nearest machine algorithm to predict the value, built witwith sklearn to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- **Model Architecture:** Build a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Training:** Train the model with the training dataset and validate it using the validation dataset.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the training process and the results using matplotlib.
